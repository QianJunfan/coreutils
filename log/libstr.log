        Brief:
                This is the first release version of libstr. 
                It implements several high-level operations for string 
                manipulation.

        Detail:
        The functions implemented in this version include:

          strsplit     - Splitting a string into an array
          strjoin      - Joining a string array back into a single string
          str_arr_free - Frees the dynamically allocated string array. 
          strtrim      - Removing whitespace from both the start and end of a
                         string.
          strltrim     - Removing whitespace only from the start of a string. 
          strrtrim     - Removing whitespace only from the end of a string.
          strreplace   - Replacing all occurrences of a substring with 
                         another substring
          strtolower   - Converting the entire string to lowercase.
          strtoupper   - Converting the entire string to uppercase. 
          streqi       - Performing a case-insensitive comparison between two 
                         strings.
          strstarts    - Checking if a string begins with a specified substring.
          strends      - Checking if a string ends with a specified substring.

        Next:
                This library will only receive functional updates when requested
                by other libraries or Coreutils.
                Otherwise, it will only receive bug fixes and maintenance 
                updates
