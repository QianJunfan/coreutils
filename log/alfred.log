> Alpha 0.1.1   (Nov 27, 2025)
        
        Currently, alfred has switch to libfile library for file operations. 

        Additionally, the .alfignore file has been modified to .alf, 
        and the .alf file now supports more syntax features:

                ignoring files with a specific extension
                adding comments to folders,
                and even using '#' to add comments for .alf script.
        
        Next:
                The next update will refactor the entire alfred program, and at
                the same time, add a more visually appealing output format.

                If possible, alfred will use more of Coreutils Library.
