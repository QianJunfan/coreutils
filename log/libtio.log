> Alpha 0.0.1     (Nov 27, 2025)
        Brief:
                This is the first release of libtio.
                libtio is a lightweight terminal input/output library.
                It is not yet complete enough for immediate production use.
        
        Current:
                It can implement single-line input or multi-line input.
                However, the multi-line input function, io_readm, still has
                numerous bugs...

        Next:
                The next update will focus on bug fixing.
                When I deem it sufficiently stable, I will write documentation
                for it.
