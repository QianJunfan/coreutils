1. OVERVIEW

The libfile library provides a set of lightweight utility functions for common
file and directory operations. These functions include checking existence,
counting entries, reading file content (line by line or all), and listing
directory contents.

2. PUBLIC FUNCTIONS

2.1. uint64_t file_le(const char *file_path)

    Calculates the Line Entries count for the specified file.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - Returns:   The number of lines in the file. Returns 0 if the file
                 does not exist or cannot be opened.

2.2. char **file_ls(const char *file_path)

    Reads all content of the specified file and returns it as a List of Strings 
    (a null-terminated array of strings). Each line is a separate string
    element, with the trailing newline character removed.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - Returns:   A char** array containing all lines from the file. The
                 last element of the array is NULL. 
                 Returns NULL if the file does not exist, cannot be opened, 
                 or if memory allocation fails.
    - Note:      The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory 
                 (e.g., using a dedicated array-freeing function).

2.3. char *file_li(const char *file_path, uint64_t cnt)

    Reads the content of a Line Indexed by number from the specified file.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - cnt:       The line number to read (1-based index).
    - Returns:   A dynamically allocated copy of the specified line, with the 
                 trailing newline character removed. 
                 Returns NULL if the file does not exist, cannot be opened, 
                 the line index is out of bounds, or if memory allocation fails.
    - Note:      The caller must use free() to release the returned string.

2.4. bool file_ex(const char *file_path)

    Checks if the given path Exists and is a regular file.
    - file_path: The file path to check.
    - Returns:   true: If the path exists and is a regular file.
                 false: Otherwise.

2.5. bool dir_ex(const char *dict_path)

    Checks if the given path Exists and is a directory.
    - dict_path: The directory path to check.
    - Returns:   true: If the path exists and is a directory.
                 false: Otherwise.

2.6. uint64_t dir_le(const char *dict_path)

    Calculates the List Entries count in the specified directory
    (including '.' and '..').
    - dict_path: The path to the directory.
    - Returns:   The number of entries in the directory. Returns 0 if the
                 directory does not exist or cannot be opened.

2.7. char **dir_ls(const char *dict_path)

    Reads all List of Strings (entry names) from the specified directory.
    - dict_path: The path to the directory.
    - Returns:   A char** array containing the names of all directory entries.
                 The list includes '.' and '..', and the last element is NULL.
                 Returns NULL if the directory does not exist, cannot be opened,
                 or if memory allocation fails.
    - Note:      The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
