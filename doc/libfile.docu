1. OVERVIEW

The libfile library provides a set of lightweight utility
functions for common file and directory operations.


2. PUBLIC FUNCTIONS

2.1. File Read Operations

2.1.1. uint64_t file_le(const char *file_path)

    Calculates the Line Entries count for the file.

    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - Returns:   The number of lines in the file.
                 Returns 0 if the file is non-existent or 
                 cannot be opened.

2.1.2. char **file_ls(const char *file_path)

    Reads all file content as a null-terminated List of
    Strings. The trailing newline is removed from 
    each line.

    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - Returns:   A char** array of all lines. The last 
                 element is NULL. Returns NULL on 
                 non-existence, open failure, or allocation failure.
    - Note:      The caller must free the allocated memory 
                 (array and strings).

2.1.3. char *file_li(const char *file_path, uint64_t cnt)

    Reads the content of a Line Indexed by number.

    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - cnt:       The line number to read (1-based index).
    - Returns:   A dynamically allocated copy of the line, 
                 with the newline removed. Returns NULL 
                 on error, out of bounds, or allocation failure.
    - Note:      The caller must use free() to release the 
                 returned string.

2.1.4. bool file_ex(const char *file_path)

    Checks if the path Exists and is a regular file.

    - file_path: The file path to check.
    - Returns:   true: If a regular file exists.
                 false: Otherwise.


2.2. File Write Operations

2.2.1. bool file_ws(const char *file_path, const char *content)

    Writes a String to a file, overwriting existing content.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - content:   The string content to write.
    - Returns:   true on success, false on error (e.g., permission).

2.2.2. bool file_wa(const char *file_path, const char *content)

    Writes a String, Appending it to the end of the file.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - content:   The string content to append.
    - Returns:   true on success, false on error.

2.2.3. bool file_wls(const char *file_path, char **lines)

    Writes a List of Strings (lines) to a file, overwriting 
    existing content. Each element is written to a new line.
    - file_path: The path to the file.
    - lines:     The NULL-terminated array of strings.
    - Returns:   true on success, false on error.


2.3. Directory Operations

2.3.1. bool dir_ex(const char *dict_path)

    Checks if the path Exists and is a directory.

    - dict_path: The directory path to check.
    - Returns:   true: If a directory exists.
                 false: Otherwise.

2.3.2. uint64_t dir_le(const char *dict_path)

    Calculates the List Entries count in the directory (including
    '.' and '..').

    - dict_path: The path to the directory.
    - Returns:   The number of entries in the directory.
                 Returns 0 if the directory is non-existent 
                 or cannot be opened.

2.3.3. char **dir_ls(const char *dict_path)

    Reads all List of Strings (entry names) from the directory.

    - dict_path: The path to the directory.
    - Returns:   A char** array of all directory entry names.
                 Includes '.' and '..', and the last element is 
                 NULL. Returns NULL on error or 
                 allocation failure.
    - Note:      The caller must free the allocated memory.
