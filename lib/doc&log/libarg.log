Development Log of libarg

> Alpha 0.1.0   (Nov 20, 2025)
        Brief:
                The main features are complete, but it is still a work in
                progress.

        Current:
                The overall architecture has been established.

                Some APIs have been implemented:                        
                        Register a Command via argc.
                        Register an Option via argo.
                        Initialize the entire libarg via argi.
                        Check if a Command/Option appeared via arge.

                Libarg can successfully read and parse command-line arguments.

                But, It's not yet possible to read the corresponding values of
                the command-line arguments.

                And there are still some bugs and memory management issues in
                the current version.

        Next:
                The next update will focus on code implementation 
                optimization and documentation, alongside bug fixes.
