Coreutils Development Log

> Alpha 0.1.4   (Nov 28, 2025)
        A 'guide' folder has been added to the lib directory for easier library 
        testing and usage examples.

        libfile (updated from alpha 0.1.0 to alpha 0.1.1)
                Added fundamental file writing APIs.
        
        libstr  (updated from alpha 0.1.0 to alpha 0.1.1)
                Expanded the function set.


> Alpha 0.1.3   (Nov 27, 2025)
        To prevent them from being opened by Microsoft Word (since they are 
        just plain text files), the extensions of all files in the doc folder 
        were changed from .doc to .docu.

        Add libstr for better string handling.
        Add libtio for basic terminal input / output.
        
        A makefile has been added, and it automatically compiles and links all
        files under uti.
        
        libstr (updated from _ to alpha 0.1.0)
                This is the first release of libstr.
                This library provides efficient and common string utilities 
                missing from the standard C library (string.h). 
                All currently required functionality has been completed.

        libtio (updated from _ to alpha 0.0.1)
                This is the first release of libtio.
                libtio is a lightweight terminal input/output library.
                It is not yet complete enough for immediate production use.

                It can implement single-line input or multi-line input.
                However, the multi-line input function, io_readm, still has
                numerous bugs...
        
        alfred (updated from alpha 0.1.0 to alpha 0.1.1)
        
                Currently, alfred has switch to libfile library for file 
                operations.

                Additionally, the .alfignore file has been modified to .alf, 
                and the .alf file now supports more syntax features:
                        - ignoring files with a specific extension
                        - adding comments to folders,
                        - and even using '#' to add comments for .alf script.


> Alpha 0.1.2   (Nov 25, 2025)
        Added libfile for basic file opeation.
        To unify the naming, the name of libtim was changed to libtime, but the 
        specific functionality remains unchanged.

        Add documentation for libfile.

        libfile (updated from _ to alpha 0.1.0)
                This is the first release of libfile. 
                All currently required functionality has been completed.

        Added libtim for time formatting and processing.
        Add API reference documentation for libarg and libtim

        libtim (updated from _ to alpha 0.1.0)
               This is the first release of libtim. 
               All currently required functionality has been completed.

        libarg (updated from alpha 0.1.0 to 0.1.1)
                This is a stability update focusing on critical bug fixes 
                and memory safety. 
                The library is now considered truly ready for use.

        This is the first update,
        which adds the libarg library and the alfred tool to coreutils.

        libarg (updated from _ to alpha 0.1.0)
                The main features are complete, but it is still a work in
                progress.

        alfred (updated from _ to alpha 0.1.0)
